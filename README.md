# Bonzai

***Note:*** This project is currently under construction.

***Bonzai is my preliminary Capstone platform which will become a toolkit within a web-based service for medium- and large-scale business employees to seek fulfillment in the workplace.***

## Current Capstone Synthesis

Bonzai will encompass self-actualization services tailored to employees of medium- to large-scale businesses and organizations. This platform will address the following question: *How can fulfillment-related services connected to the workplace optimize self-actualization in both workplace and non-workplace activities?* Consequently, employees will feel more fulfilled with their work, more connected to their business of employ, and more compelled to take initiative to optimize work-related activities. 

The need for increased fulfillment in the workplace is very concrete and current. A McKinsey study reported that more than one-third (36%) of employees returning to on-site work reported negative mental health (Staglin, 2022). Moreover, only 56% of people currently feel satisfied with their jobs and 76% consider reassessing their work choices (Lica, 2021). With increased job dissatisfaction and pivoting, it is essential that employees have tools to discover the value of every business and every occupation.

My platform will address six areas of fulfillment relevant to life (emotional, mental, physical, practical, social, and spiritual) and five areas of fulfillment specific to work (independence, mental health, physical health, productivity, and sociability). These life and work frameworks have overlap which is mutually exclusive as pertaining specifically to the workplace or to life outside of work. 

**Bonzai's Main Feature:**

**Feature 1: Enscribe:** A journaling platform with sentiment analysis and cybersecurity techniques (e.g., cryptographic methods such as symmetric encryption) to ensure safe data storage and privacy.

***Optional Features:***

**Feature 2: Blend:** A company chat matching platform where two people from the same workplace are matched for a chat over coffee or tea virtually or in-person. This platform would also rotate matches each week.

**Feature 3: Catalyst:** An incentives platform where benefits provided by the workplace are promoted and tracked for individual employees or employee groups.
