***Note:*** This project is currently under construction.

***Bonzai is my preliminary Capstone project for Minerva University which will become a web-based toolkit for medium- and large-scale business employees to seek fulfillment in the workplace.***

## Current Capstone Synthesis

Bonzai will encompass self-actualization services tailored to employees of medium- to large-scale businesses and organizations. This platform addresses five areas of work-related fulfillment (i.e., independence, mental health, physical health, productivity, and sociability) and aims to generate a workplace with increased job satisfaction, management communication, and decision-making autonomy. Consequently, employees will feel more fulfilled with their work, more connected to their business of employ, and more compelled to take initiative to optimize work-related activities. 

The need for increased fulfillment in the workplace is very concrete and current. A McKinsey study reported that more than one-third (36%) of employees returning to on-site work reported negative mental health (Staglin, 2022). Moreover, only 56% of people currently feel satisfied with their jobs and 76% consider reassessing their work choices (Lica, 2021). With increased job dissatisfaction and pivoting, it is essential that employees have tools to discover the value of every business and every occupation.

Moreover, today's employees feel greater fulfillment with workplaces which (1) provide indpendence and decision-making capabilities, (2) give time for non-work-related outlets, and (3) improve life desirability and judgement execution for good character. Having individualistic strategies to enable independence is crucial (Mazerolle, 2013) including environmental factors (e.g., opportunities for promotion) arising from workplace norms (Taylor et al., 2011); thus, further incentives to engage in workplaces promotes judgement execution, increases life desirability, and provides opportunities to act on good character (Twenge et al., 2005). Bonzai's focuses on independence, initiative, and incentives provision a platform fit for a more fulfilling workplace and increased productivity and effectiveness from work output.

The following are Bonzai's three features which, together, address all five areas of fulfillment in the workplace:

**Bonzai's Main Features:**

**Feature 1: Enscribe:** A journaling platform with sentiment analysis and cybersecurity techniques (e.g., cryptographic methods such as symmetric encryption) to ensure safe data storage and privacy. Addresses independence and mental health.

**Feature 2: Blend:** A company chat matching platform where two people from the same workplace are matched for a chat over coffee or tea virtually or in-person. This platform would also rotate matches each week. Addresses mental health and sociability.

**Feature 3: Catalyst:** An incentives platform where benefits provided by the workplace are promoted and tracked for individual employees or employee groups. Addresses mental health, physical health, productivity, and sociability.

***Optional Feature:***

**Analytics:** A separate feature which tracks the effective use of the other three main features of Bonzai for company-wide data tracking related to workplace fulfillment.

***Note:*** *My final Capstone project for Minerva University consists of this GitHub repository deliverable as well as an interactive Figma prototype and business plan which will be presented in conjunction with this resource to academic stakeholders.
